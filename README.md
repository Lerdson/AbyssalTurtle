- 👋 Hi, I’m @AbyssalTurtle
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, programming and archery.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning financial tech, Scheme, Lisp and game engine design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project but I'm mainly proficient in Python, Java, C/C++. I used to do Golang for a living but I'm a little rusty now.
- 📫 Reach me at my github-specific email address, abyssalturtle@gmail.com.
